## Epileptic figures

I made this when I was bored. 

### Usage

```
./epileptic_figures <figure>
```

This program will just draw a figure in a SDL OpenGL window that will continously change colors in microseconds (epilepsia warning). The figures available can be viewed in the source code.

### Compiling

You will need the SDL2 and OpenGL libraries to compile and run the program. And it's designed for running on UNIX systems.
